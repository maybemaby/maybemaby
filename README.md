### Hello, and welcome! 

My name is Brandon and I primarily work on web development projects. I also enjoy creating data visualizations and automation. My education is in Materials Science Engineering and my day job is more in hardwarre engineering but I ended up really enjoying coding and have stuck with it since. I started with Python and am also currently using Javascript + Typescript. In general, I am constantly trying to find new stuff to learn and am really enjoying the journey.

If you'd like to see more about my projects and skills, you can also check out my [personal portfolio](https://brandonma.dev/).

Currently Learning:
- Go
- Astro
- React Router v7

:dog: Fun Fact: The dog in my profile picture is a dog I fostered named Max who was half Jindo half Corgi.
